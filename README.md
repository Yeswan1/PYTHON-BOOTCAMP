- Python syntax and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming
- Error handling and debugging

### Data Science & Analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting

### Database Management
- **SQLite**: Database creation, queries, and management
- SQL fundamentals and advanced operations

### Advanced Topics
- **Multithreading**: Concurrent programming concepts
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web application development
- Performance optimization techniques

## üìö Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- No prior programming experience required (we start from the basics!)
- Enthusiasm to learn and practice coding

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### 1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda
Download and install the appropriate version for your OS from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning during installation:** It is generally recommended **not** to add Anaconda to your system's PATH variable. This helps prevent conflicts with other software.

### 2. Install Visual Studio Code
- Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install the **Python Extension**: Open VS Code, go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), and install the "Python" extension from Microsoft

### 3. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yeswan1/PYTHON-BOOTCAMP.git
cd PYTHON-BOOTCAMP
```

### 4. Create and Activate Conda Environment
Open **Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or your terminal (macOS/Linux):

```bash
# Create environment from environment.yml (if available)
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Or create a new environment manually
conda create -n python-bootcamp python=3.8 pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlite streamlit jupyter

# Activate the environment
conda activate python-bootcamp
```

### 5. Configure VS Code
- Open your project folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder`)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Select the correct Python interpreter
  - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
  - Search for "Python: Select Interpreter"
  - Choose your `python-bootcamp` environment
- Verify the terminal shows `(python-bootcamp)` in the prompt



## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Learning Path
1. **Start with the basics** and work through topics in alphabetical order
2. **Complete assignments** in each section before checking solutions
3. **Practice with provided exercises** to reinforce learning
